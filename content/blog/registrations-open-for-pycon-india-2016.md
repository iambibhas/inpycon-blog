PyCon India is one of *the* most affordable and entirely community run professional
conferences in India, and we strive to keep it that way. As much as we try, inflation
is just something that we can't do much about and hence, the small changes will reflect.
Here are the pricing tiers for this year's conference:

1. Early Python          : Rs. 1000 (200 tickets. No cancellation. Transferable)
2. Regular Python        : Rs. 1500
3. Student Python        : Rs. 1000
4. On-the-spot Python    : Rs. 2500 (For two days)
5. Workshop Python       : Rs. 1000 Per workshop

Tickets 1 to 4 gives you full access to the conference for two days, including breakfast,
 lunch, tea & snacks and a T-shirt. The workshop ticket has to be bought separately for
each workshop that you want to attend. We'll announce them as soon as we finalize them.

Cheers folks! Hope to see you at PyCon India!
